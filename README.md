## Introduction
This is an exercise project that aims to get familiar with vue.js and Spring Boot by building a library management system. The system can manage books, categories, users, administrators, borrowings and returns. It also provides a line chart module to visualize the statistics of the library.

The system uses vue.js as the front-end framework and Spring Boot as the back-end framework. It also uses Element UI for the user interface design and Echarts for the data visualization. The system can help librarians to easily access and manage the library resources. It can also improve the efficiency and security of the library operations.

## Features
- <b>CRUD functions: </b>Administrators can create, read, update, and delete information for books, categories, users, administrators, borrow records, and return records.
- <b>Data visualization function: </b>Administrators can view a line chart that shows the statistics of the library, such as the number of books borrowed and returned.  
- <b>Login function: </b>Administrators need to log in to the system before they can perform any data manipulation. The system verifies the username and password of the administrators and prevents unauthorized access.  
- <b>MD5 encryption algorithm: </b>The system encrypts sensitive information, such as passwords, using the MD5 algorithm. Only the encrypted information is stored in the MySQL database, which enhances the security of the system. 
- <b>Point management functions: </b>Users need to pay points to borrow books. The system refunds the points when users return the books in advance. The system charges additional points when users do not return the books according to the due date. 
- <b>Account freezing function: </b>The system automatically freezes the account of a user who has negative points. Administrators can manually unfreeze the account after the user pays back the points.
